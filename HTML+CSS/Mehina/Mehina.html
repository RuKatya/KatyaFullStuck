    <div class="about">
        <p>The preparatory course lasted 10 months, from September to June, in the year I was in we were 2 groups when each group had 30 people. Years later the mechina grew into a larger number of groups.</p>
        <p>Preparatory work for me was one step ahead of independence - I learned to manage my money, but in addition I taught others to cook, clean and wash. We lived in a shared apartment with several people and learned to run a household together and
            even renovated the apartment during the year we lived in it.</p>
        <p>During the preparatory course, we went on several field trips, including navigations and trips with a stretcher. In these journeys we have learned to support and strengthen each other in difficult moments. The journeys lasted several days, some
            were more difficult and some easier. The avenues were the hardest journey - during we went out into the desert in February and had to deal with cold at night, lack of sleep, lack of food and lots of walks.</p>
